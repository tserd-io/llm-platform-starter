# Tradeoffs

## Included

- Deterministic mock provider for local development and CI
- Optional OpenAI provider behind an extra dependency
- JSON prompt registry to avoid requiring external services
- Pydantic validation for structured outputs
- SQLite trace store for transparent local observability

## Deferred

- Multi-tenant auth and RBAC
- Prompt approval workflow
- Distributed tracing backend
- Full PII redaction pipeline
- RAG retrieval service
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Advanced eval rubrics and human review UI

The goal is to show platform thinking without turning the repo into an unfinished enterprise system.
