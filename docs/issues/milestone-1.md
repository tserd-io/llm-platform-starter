# Milestone 1 Issue Tickets: Runnable MVP

Milestone 1 focuses on making the project easy to run, inspect, and trust from a fresh clone. These tickets are scoped so each can be implemented independently.

## 1. Add CLI Entry Points For Classify, Eval, And Metrics

Purpose:
Expose the platform through simple commands, not only Python modules, so the MVP workflow is easy to demonstrate.

Tasks:

- Add a console script in `pyproject.toml`.
- Add `llm-platform classify`.
- Add `llm-platform eval`.
- Add `llm-platform metrics`.
- Keep command output JSON-friendly.

Acceptance criteria:

- `llm-platform classify --subject "Refund" --body "Duplicate charge"` returns valid JSON.
- `llm-platform eval` returns an eval summary.
- `llm-platform metrics` works against the configured SQLite trace DB.
- Tests cover the CLI commands without requiring live API keys.

Suggested labels:

- `enhancement`
- `developer-experience`
- `mvp`

## 2. Add Provider Factory

Purpose:
Make provider selection explicit, configurable, and production-shaped.

Tasks:

- Add a provider factory module.
- Support `mock` by default.
- Support `openai` only when configured.
- Raise clear errors for unknown providers or missing API key.
- Update API and example flows to use the factory where appropriate.

Acceptance criteria:

- Tests cover mock provider creation.
- Tests cover unsupported provider errors.
- OpenAI provider is never required for CI.
- Configuration remains simple for local mock-mode usage.

Suggested labels:

- `enhancement`
- `provider-gateway`
- `mvp`

## 3. Add Retry And Timeout Wrapper

Purpose:
Show minimal platform reliability behavior around provider calls without turning the MVP into a large framework.

Tasks:

- Add basic retry and timeout settings.
- Wrap provider calls with retry handling.
- Track provider failure categories in traces.
- Keep the mock provider deterministic.
- Document the reliability behavior in the README or tradeoffs doc.

Acceptance criteria:

- Failed provider calls record trace metadata when possible.
- Unit tests cover retry exhaustion.
- Timeout/retry defaults are visible in settings.
- README explains this as a minimal reliability pattern.

Suggested labels:

- `enhancement`
- `provider-gateway`
- `observability`
- `mvp`

## 4. Improve Eval Report

Purpose:
Make evals feel like platform regression tooling rather than a one-off script.

Tasks:

- Add schema validity rate.
- Add needs-review rate.
- Add average latency.
- Add estimated cost.
- Add JSON report output.
- Preserve per-case results.

Acceptance criteria:

- `llm-platform eval` prints summary metrics.
- Eval report includes per-case results.
- Tests validate the report shape.
- Eval execution remains deterministic with the mock provider.

Suggested labels:

- `enhancement`
- `evals`
- `mvp`
